            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system,
                which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under various articles
                of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and 
                compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.
                Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education
                policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India’s constitutional states.
                The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a ‘concurrent subject’.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the "10+2" pattern of education.
                In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges (Mumbai, Maharashtra),
                and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree for college.
                The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education,
                6 years of High School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges.
                This pattern originated from the recommendation of the Education Commission of 1964–66.</p>
